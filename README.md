<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Users can fill out a registration form with fields for their name email phone number password and password confirmation.
*   Input data is validated both on the client side (using HTML attributes) and the server side (using express-validator). Express-validator checks for a valid email format password length and complexity.
*   Passwords are securely stored in the MongoDB database. Password complexity requirements (uppercase lowercase number) are enforced.
*   MongoDB is used as the backend database to store user information. The Mongoose library facilitates communication with the MongoDB database.
*   Before storing user data the server checks if a user with the same email or phone number already exists. If a duplicate is found the registration process is halted and an error message is sent.
*   The registration form is designed to be responsive providing a consistent user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
*   Comprehensive error handling is implemented both on the client and server sides. Error messages are communicated to the user for better feedback.
*   JavaScript is used to enhance the user experience making the registration process more interactive and dynamic.
*   Upon successful registration users are redirected to a welcome page.
